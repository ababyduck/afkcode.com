This project will contain my personal website, which is primarily intended for school projects for now.

## Planned features:
- Self-contained website based on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework for Python, to be hosted within a DigitalOcean droplet
- Portfolio page to show off projects from each of my classes as I progress through my [Computer Science undergrad at CSUMB](https://csumb.edu/csonline/).
- Learning blog: Will migrate my existing content from Blogger and post all future content here

This project will contain my personal website, which is primarily intended for school projects for now.

## Planned features:
- Self-contained website based on the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web framework for Python, to be hosted within a DigitalOcean droplet
- Portfolio page to showcase projects from each of my classes as I progress through my [Computer Science undergrad at CSUMB](https://csumb.edu/csonline/).
- Learning blog: Will migrate my existing content from Blogger and post all future content here

## What I learned:
- **How to create and deploy to a DigitalOcean "droplet" VPS.** Droplets are awesome. $5/month to host my django app is hard to pass up, especially when [GitHub's student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) comes with a $100 DigitalOcean credit.  DigitalOcean's "App Platform" seems a lot more convenient since it can link directly to GitHub or Gitlab and update itself whenever you update a branch, but they want another $7/month to host your database if you go this route.
